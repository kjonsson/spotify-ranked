# What ?
- Spotify clone for web
  - Wanted to be able to view all songs in most-played order when I go to artist page

# Tech used
- tailwind
- nextjs
- typescript
- deployed on vercel: <URL>

# Tech used

# Things to consider
- auto building
- run tsc in build but also locally
- comments
- add or  remove tailwind scrollbar hide library
- env variable public vs not


# TODO
- globally catch space bar to play/pause
- show playbar where it shows current play status
- name of artist on artist page should not just be taken from track
- we are getting all tracks from albums that the artist possibly just had one song on
- logout is hardly clickable
- logget out and logged in layout ... clean
- split into more hooks (useCurrentPlaying, useArtist, useSong, ...something) and split data better
- root and other routes do not redirect to login
- performant lists for songs
- closable sidebar
